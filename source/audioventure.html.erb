          After 6 months in the making, The Audioventure launched in May of 2021. This is a massive collaboration between over 20 gamers and game developers including 18 composers, 2 mix engineers, 2 visual artists, a programmer, and Ray "Raydee99" Demers. Raydee99 organized the entire project as producer and project manager along with composing 8 different tracks that are featured throughout this interactive album.
